"Aphrodite"
By: The Ridleys

[Refrain]
Ikaw ang buwan na kumikinang sa langit
Iniilawan ang mundo kapag ito'y bughaw
Bituin ay sumasayaw, kahit gabihin na
Di mo ba alam na para sa'yo lang sila sumasayaw?

[Verse 1]
There you are, above darkened clouds
Smiling at the world from afar
With the stars, you wander around
May they follow you wherever you are

[Verse 2]
Here I am, just another boy
Singing songs that others have sung
Tryna find the words to employ
To adore the goddess of love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, you've got me in a daze, yeah
No, woah, it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because

[Chorus]
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes
And I can't speak, no I can't speak at all
I swear to Zeus, you're Aphrodite in disguise
Don't think that you can hide it from me
Oh, no, I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine
Oh, I can't breathe, no I can't breathe at all
Aphrodite, could you, could you please be mine? Oh
Could you please be mine, oh, mine?

[Verse 3]
Here you are, I've waited so long
Hoping you would sit down and stay
'Cause with the stars, I've been dancing along
Like a fool, so you'd look my way

[Refrain]
You're the moon that glows in the sky
Lighting up my world when it's blue
Here I sing, though late in the night
Hope you know I sing just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, you've got me in a daze, yeah
No, woah, it's not another phase
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you
And it's all because

[Chorus]
Kalawaka'y kita sa'yong mga mata
Hindi, hindi na maka- 'di makasalita
Sumpa kay Zeus, ikaw ang dyosa ng ganda
Hindi mo matatago sa'kin
Hinding hindi inakalang ako'y mapalapit sayo
Hindi, hindi na maka- hindi makahinga
Aphrodite, puwendeng akin ka nalang? oh
Akin ka na lang, oh, akin?
Akin ka na lang, oh, akin?
