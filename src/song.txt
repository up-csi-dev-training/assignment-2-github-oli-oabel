"Aphrodite"
By: The Ridleys

[Refrain]
You're the moon that glows in the sky 🌕
Lighting up the world when it's blue 💙
Stars they dance, though late in the night ✨
Don't you know they dance just for you? 💫

[Verse 1]
There you are, above darkened clouds
Smiling at the world from afar
With the stars, you wander around
May they follow you wherever you are

[Verse 2]
Here I am, just another boy
Singing songs that others have sung
Tryna find the words to employ
To adore the goddess of love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, you've got me in a daze, yeah 😵‍💫
No, woah, it's not another phase 🔄
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you 👀
And it's all because 💞

[Chorus]
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes 🌌
And I can't speak, no I can't speak at all 🤐
I swear to Zeus, you're Aphrodite in disguise ⚡
Don't think that you can hide it from me 🕵️‍♂️
Oh, no, I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine 😇
Oh, I can't breathe, no I can't breathe at all 😮‍💨
Aphrodite, could you, could you please be mine? Oh 💘
Could you please be mine, oh, mine? 💞

[Verse 3]
Here you are, I've waited so long
Hoping you would sit down and stay
'Cause with the stars, I've been dancing along
Like a fool, so you'd look my way

[Refrain]
You're the moon that glows in the sky 🌕
Lighting up my world when it's blue 💙
Here I sing, though late in the night 🎤
Hope you know I sing just for you 💫

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, you've got me in a daze, yeah 😵‍💫
No, woah, it's not another phase 🔄
You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you 👀
And it's all because 💞

[Chorus]
I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes 🌌
And I can't speak, no I can't speak at all 🤐
I swear to Zeus, you're Aphrodite in disguise ⚡
Don't think that you can hide it from me 🕵️‍♂️
Oh, no, I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine 😇
Oh, I can't breathe, no I can't breathe at all 😮‍💨
Aphrodite, could you, could you please be mine? Oh 💘
Could you please be mine, oh, mine? 💞
Could you please be mine, oh, mine? 💞
